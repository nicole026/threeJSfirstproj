  // timeline, the second link i liked up top, allows you to do a one-by-one animation action (? these are my words lol)

  // use this line to have animation happen immeidately on load/refresh
  // this.tl = new TimelineMax().delay(0.3);

  this.tl = new TimelineMax({ paused: true }); // wont run because its paused, we have to tell it when to run
  this.tl.to(
    mesh.scale, // reference mesh, scale initially
    1, // duration of 1
    { x: 2, ease: Expo.easeOut } // scale on x axis
  );
  this.tl.to(mesh.scale, 0.5, { x: 0.5, ease: Expo.easeOut });

  this.tl.to(
    mesh.rotation,
    0.5,
    { y: Math.PI * 0.5, ease: Expo.easeOut },
    '=-1.5' // happens 1.5 seconds before it normally would... idk why this is worthwhile other than it keeps my cube a cube, whereas without it my cube becomes skinny
